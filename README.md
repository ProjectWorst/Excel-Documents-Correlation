# Project-Python-Cosine

Purpose: This capability allows me to compare/correlate information from separate documents using cosine calculations within the Python program.
Normally, without this capability and depending on how large the data set is, this task could take over a few weeks/months trying to make determinations on my own.  

The following are the imports and downloads required to make sure the necessary Python capabilities are in place before the rest of your code is established. 
 
1) import pandas as pd
2) import nltk
3) from nltk.corpus import stopwords
4) from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
5) import string
6) from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
7) from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
8) nltk.download('stopwords')
9) nltk.download('punkt')

Below are explanations of each import and download mentioned above: 

1) `pandas` (imported as `pd`): Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling and processing structured data, such as tables or spreadsheets. With pandas, you can load, transform, filter, and analyze data easily.

2) `nltk`: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a library for working with human language data. It offers various tools and resources for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In the code you provided, NLTK is used for text preprocessing and tokenization.

3 & 4) `stopwords` and `word_tokenize` (from `nltk.corpus` and `nltk.tokenize`): These are specific modules within NLTK. `stopwords` provides a collection of common words that are typically removed during text analysis, such as "and," "the," or "is." `word_tokenize` is a tokenizer that splits text into individual words or tokens, which is useful for further text processing.

5) `string`: This is a standard Python library that provides a set of common string operations. In the given code, it is likely being used to access punctuation characters, which can be helpful for text cleaning or analysis.

6) `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`: This is a module from scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library. TfidfVectorizer is a text feature extraction technique that converts text documents into numerical vectors. It calculates the importance of words in a document based on term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and transforms the text into a matrix representation suitable for machine learning algorithms.

7) `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`: This module from scikit-learn provides a function to calculate the cosine similarity between pairs of vectors. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, often used in information retrieval and text analysis to compare documents based on their content.

8) nltk.download('stopwords'): This line triggers the download of the stopwords resource from NLTK. Stopwords are common words in a language that are often removed from text during NLP tasks because they typically do not contribute much to the overall meaning of the text. Examples of stopwords in English include “and,” “the,” “is,” and so on. By downloading the stopwords resource, you ensure that you have access to a predefined set of stopwords for your text preprocessing tasks.

9) nltk.download('punkt'): This line triggers the download of the punkt resource from NLTK. The punkt resource includes pre-trained models and data for tokenization, specifically for sentence and word tokenization. Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units, such as sentences or words, to facilitate further analysis.
